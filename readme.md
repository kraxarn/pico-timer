basic timer for the rp2040 and ssd1306.
also includes a button for start/stop/reset and a dip switch for adjusting time.

why? i have adhd/add and setting a timer on any other more advanced device would distract me and make me forget.
also my first project with a mcu, so a simple project like this feels like a good first project.
